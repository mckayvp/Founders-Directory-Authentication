# Project-4-Founders-Directory-Authentication


For this project I added authentication to a Founders Directory foundation provided by Dr. Liddle. 

When a new device first clicks the Sign In button they create an account with a username and password.

After that they can login with their username and password or use biometric authentication. 

Checks are made to see which type of biometric auth the device has so if they are not enrolled the message telling them it is not enabled will only say the type their device supports.
